        <pre style="font-size: 18px;">
            Write down a program to display the searched data and sorted data from the Array of Objects.

            Requirements:

            There should be User Input which defines the number of records [n]  to store. Then the user must fill the information which is required for the data for the "n" records.
            The keys of data should be stored in UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case format. There should be a key which holds a function which returns output in console. 
            The data should be sorted based on any field that you prefer. (Ascending & Descending order)
            The User should be able to search for the records and should give the desired output. 

            Output:
            1) Display the Records as the User have Filled (No Filteration or Sort)
            2) Display the records sorted in ascending order and descending order
            3) Display the records filtered with the search input
